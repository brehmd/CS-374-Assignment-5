Servers:
    - use a child process to do encryption and decryption
    - up to 5 at a time
    - proper error messages and exiting
    - Check that key is at least as long as plaintext/ciphertext
    - check arguments passed by send (?? not really needed)
    - in index helper function, return an error instead of -1
    - survive but send a message to client if the wrong one connects

Clients:
    - Check that key is at least as long as plaintext/ciphertext
    - check arguments, make sure there are correct amount
    - Check for bad characters in text
    - client terminates if connecting to wrong server
